The space complexity for Weighted Uniform Strings is O(n + m) where n is the number of weights that the code needs to store and m is the number of queries being processed.
The time complexity for Weighted Uniform is also O(n + m) because this time n would be the length of the input while m is still the number of queries being processed.

The space complexity for Mini-Max is  O(1) because the space needed to process the function never increases with the number of inputs
The time complexity for Mini-Max is O(nlogn) due to the Collections.sort function having a time complexity of O(nlogn) which dominates the time complexity of the work being done in the for loop which is O(n)
